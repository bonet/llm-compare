Moby-Dick is a novel by Herman Melville, first published in 1851, that tells the story of the obsessive quest of Ahab, captain of the whaling ship Pequod, for revenge against Moby Dick, the white sperm whale that on a previous voyage destroyed Ahab's ship and severed his leg at the knee. The novel is narrated by Ishmael, a sailor on the Pequod who provides a detailed account of the journey, the crew, and their encounters with whales.

The Pequod sets sail from Nantucket with a diverse crew, including the harpooneers Queequeg and Tashtego, and the ship's officers Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask. As the voyage progresses, Melville explores various themes such as man's relationship with nature, the concept of the sublime, and the dangers of obsession. The crew encounters several whales, and each kill is described in great detail, highlighting the danger and complexity of whaling.

Ahab's obsession with Moby Dick becomes increasingly apparent as the voyage continues. He is willing to sacrifice everything, including the lives of his crew, to exact revenge on the whale. Ahab's monomania is contrasted with the more rational and pragmatic approach of Starbuck, who tries to dissuade Ahab from his quest. However, Ahab's will is unbreakable, and he ultimately succeeds in finding Moby Dick.

The final encounter between the Pequod and Moby Dick is described in epic terms, with the whale destroying the ship and all its crew except for Ishmael. The novel ends with Ishmael's reflection on the futility of Ahab's quest and the power of nature.

Moby-Dick is considered a classic of American literature and has been interpreted in many ways, including as an allegory for the dangers of slavery, the destructive potential of technology, and the struggle between good and evil. The novel's rich symbolism, vivid descriptions, and complex characters have made it a subject of continued scholarly interest and debate.
