Moby-Dick is a novel by Herman Melville, first published in 1851, that tells the story of the obsessive quest of Ahab, captain of the whaling ship Pequod, for revenge against Moby Dick, the white sperm whale that on a previous voyage destroyed Ahab's ship and severed his leg at the knee. The novel is narrated by Ishmael, a sailor on the Pequod who provides a detailed account of life aboard a 19th-century whaling vessel and the diverse personalities of its crew.

The Pequod sets sail from Nantucket with a crew composed of men from various backgrounds and cultures, including the harpooneer Queequeg, the prophetically named Starbuck, and the mysterious Fedallah. As the ship sails toward the Pacific Ocean, Ishmael provides extensive information about whaling, the anatomy of whales, and the different types of whales hunted by whalers. The crew members bond with each other and form close relationships, but Ahab's monomaniacal focus on Moby Dick begins to affect the ship's atmosphere, creating a sense of unease and foreboding.

After several successful hunting expeditions, the Pequod finally encounters Moby Dick. In the ensuing confrontation, the whale destroys the ship's boats, drowns many crew members, and ultimately sinks the Pequod. Ishmael is the only survivor, left to recount the tale of Ahab's obsession and the tragic consequences it had for himself and his fellow sailors.

Moby-Dick is a rich and complex novel that explores themes such as obsession, fate, the nature of good and evil, and the inherent violence and cruelty of mankind. The novel is also renowned for its symbolism, metaphysical discussions, and its vivid portrayal of life at sea in the 19th century. Despite its initial mixed reception, Moby-Dick has since come to be regarded as one of the greatest American novels and a literary classic.
