Moby-Dick is a novel by Herman Melville, first published in 1851, that tells the story of the obsessive quest of Ahab, captain of the whaling ship Pequod, for revenge against Moby Dick, the white sperm whale that on a previous voyage destroyed Ahab's ship and severed his leg at the knee. The novel is narrated by Ishmael, a sailor on the Pequod who provides a detailed account of life aboard a 19th-century whaling vessel, as well as extensive information about whales and whaling.

The Pequod sets sail from Nantucket with a diverse crew, including the narrator Ishmael, the harpooneer Queequeg, and a number of other experienced sailors. As the voyage progresses, Ahab's obsession with Moby Dick becomes increasingly apparent, and he is willing to sacrifice everything, including the lives of his crew, to find and kill the whale. The crew, although initially hesitant, eventually succumbs to Ahab's charisma and determination, and they all become consumed by the hunt.

The novel reaches its climax in a dramatic confrontation between the Pequod and Moby Dick. In a tragic turn of events, the whale destroys the ship and all its crew, except for Ishmael. He survives to tell the tale, left floating on a coffin in the middle of the ocean. The novel ends with Ishmael's reflection on the futility of Ahab's quest and the power of the natural world.

The novel is also known for its rich and vivid language, its detailed descriptions of whaling, and its complex and symbolic characters.
