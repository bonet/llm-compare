Sure, here is a 5-paragraph summary of Moby-Dick:

Paragraph 1: The story begins with the introduction of the protagonist, Ishmael, who has signed up for a whaling expedition on the ship Pequod. The ship is captained by the vengeful and obsessive Ahab, who seeks to hunt down and kill the white sperm whale Moby-Dick, who had destroyed his ship and leg in a previous encounter. Ishmael and the other crew members are unaware of Ahab's true intentions, and they set sail on their journey.

Paragraph 2: As the crew sets out to sea, they encounter various challenges, including rough weather and a lack of food. Ishmael befriends several of the crew members, including the cook Queequeg, who becomes his closest friend. Ahab remains obsessed with his quest for Moby-Dick, often ignoring the welfare of his crew in pursuit of his goal.

Paragraph 3: The Pequod encounters a group of whales, and Ahab becomes increasingly agitated as he fails to find Moby-Dick. In a fit of rage, he orders his men to harpoon one of the whales, causing it to beach itself and die. Ishmael and Queequeg are horrified by Ahab's actions, but they are unable to stop him.

Paragraph 4: As the Pequod continues its journey, Ahab becomes more and more consumed by his obsession with Moby-Dick. He begins to see the whale as a symbol of evil, and he becomes increasingly paranoid and isolated. Ishmael and the other crew members begin to suspect that something is wrong with Ahab, but they are unable to stop him from pursuing his destructive course.

Paragraph 5: In the climactic final encounter, the Pequod encounters Moby-Dick, and Ahab engages in a fierce battle with the whale. Despite his best efforts, Ahab is unable to kill Moby-Dick, and he is dragged underwater by the whale's harpoon line. The Pequod sinks, and Ishmael and the other surviving crew members are left to ponder the tragedy that has unfolded. Throughout the novel, Melville explores themes of obsession, revenge, and the dangers of unchecked ambition, ultimately leaving the reader with a sense of sadness and loss.
